# Hello, I am Matthew Ho 

I’m a rising Senior at UC Berkeley studying **Data Science** and **Public Health** 

I’ve worked on projects ranging from predicting delirium using COVID datasets to building dashboards for sales teams in South Africa. I love solving problems with data, especially in healthcare and social impact.

This page is a mix of my resume and projects — feel free to poke around.

## Projects I’ve Worked On

### Delirium Prediction from COVID Multi-Omic Data  
Built a machine learning model to predict if COVID patients would develop delirium, using UCSF clinical + gene expression data.  
**Tools:** `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `ML modeling`

### Housing Bias: Fairness in Appraisals  
Trained a regression model to see how appraised property values in Chicago differed from sale prices — and who that affected.  
**Tools:** `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `EDA`, `Feature Engineering`
