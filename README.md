# Hello, I am Matthew Ho 

I’m a rising Senior at UC Berkeley studying **Data Science** and **Public Health** 

I’ve worked on projects ranging from predicting delirium using COVID datasets to building dashboards for sales teams in South Africa. I love solving problems with data, especially in healthcare and social impact.

This page is a mix of my resume and projects — feel free to poke around.
